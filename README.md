# File-extension-addition-grouper-in-LINQ
a program that creates a file extension in LINQ to act as a sort method


This program is used to count file extensions and group it using LINQ. The code allows for the  ervice to read the files generated in a folder every hour and then will be allowed to return a string array containing the file names and shows the count of files grouped by the file extension. 

For this specific method when creating the program, Using the foreach loop will go ahead and actually print the file extensions count within this specific program because I designed it to be customized against the Foreach loop which meets certain parameters for run authentication more quickly when also counting Time complexity.
